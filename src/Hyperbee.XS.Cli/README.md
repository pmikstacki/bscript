# XS.Cli: Cli tooling for Hyperbee.XS

### **What is XS?**

[XS](https://github.com/Stillpoint-Software/hyperbee.xs) is a lightweight scripting language designed to simplify and enhance the use of C# expression trees.
It provides a familiar C#-like syntax while offering advanced extensibility, making it a compelling choice for developers
building domain-specific languages (DSLs), rules engines, or dynamic runtime logic systems.

XS.Cli added dotnet commands like:

- run
- compile
- repl
